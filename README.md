# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

At the momeent, it seems the project is at a satisfactory level. Although I would definitely add a couple more little animations just to add a little more flair like maybe a cup of coffee ready or something of the sort. Also maybe change some of the color schemes for certain segments as while I followed the criteria for the project, I really don't like some of the color choices given. Haha.
